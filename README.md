## Project Background/TODO:
#### THE PROBLEM:
A Node.js CLI utility to retrieve available time slots on your Google Calendar

I needed a quicker solution to list out my Google Calendar availability than manually checking for open time slots. I tried services like Calend.ly but my clients were frustrated when I sent them a link to schedule time with me. I didnâ€™t want to make them think I was too lazy to look at my own calendar.

I am in the process of creating an NPM package called amifree to remedy this problem. This page currently serves as a Privacy Policy required by Google so that users know how I am using their data through the Google API.

When I am done building the application, I will create a write-up here.

#### THE GOAL: 
The goal is to be more convenient than looking at your Calendar

#### CURRENT PROGRESS:
* Successfully authorize users

#### TO DO:
* Refactor API to handle data manipulation from command line arguments

#### Issues/Security Concerns:
* Right now, all users are forced to create their own Google API credentials for this project. I want to look into a way to have everyone use my Google API credentials without giving them access to my file.
